The accident happened on Triq Buqana in Rabat at around 10am. The spillage caused both carriageways of the main road leading to Mġarr to be closed to traffic. The driver of the DAC truck - a 35-year-old man from Marsascala - was taken to hospital by ambulance.  In a Facebook post, Transport Malta announced it had closed the road in both directions until the vehicle and the sand were cleared away.  ROTA urges segregation of high-speed traffic, bicycles  In a statement on Friday afternoon, bicycle advocacy group ROTA said the crash flagged the urgent need for better road safety measures, particularly for bicycle users. The truck, the NGO said, ended up within the bicycle lane, where, had there been a bicycle user, they could have been fatally injured. ""The current road design offers no protection for cyclists, and this tragic event highlights the pressing need for proper segregation between high-speed traffic and vulnerable road users, particularly those on bicycles,"" ROTA said. The need for protected bicycle lanes is not just a local issue - the matter has also been flagged in international road safety guidelines such as the CROW guidelines. These guidelines emphasise the importance of segregation in high-speed areas and the need for roads that are forgiving of human error, the group noted. ""In simple terms, we must ensure that the consequences of mistakes – whether made by a driver or a cyclist – are not fatal. Sadly, Malta is still without a legally binding national cycling policy that will outline clear standards for the design and implementation of safe and effective bicycle lanes. ""We cannot allow cyclists to be subjected to what is, at best, a makeshift effort that often amounts to nothing more than a splash of green paint and some rumble strips. It is not enough. Bicycle lanes need to be designed to protect cyclists – physically separated from traffic in high-speed areas, with sufficient space and barriers to prevent accidents.""",10:00,14/03/2025,death,cyclist,OTH,['35'],[],35,"Triq Buqana in Rabat, Rabat",Triq Buqana in Rabat,Rabat,4,1,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,4,2,Morning

20/07/2025,"A scooter rider injured in a hit-and-run crash in the Regional Road tunnels earlier this month is struggling to track down the driver, after being told that none of the tunnel cameras work. Giuseppe Di Dio, a 22-year-old Sicilian who works as a DJ and event organiser, was riding his Vespa 300 on July 2 at around 12.30pm when he was hit. As he entered the tunnel heading towards Swieqi, he says a van crossed into his lane, cut him off and crashed into him, knocking him off his Vespa. “I feel super lucky to tell the story. It hurt a lot. When I was on the floor, I could feel my burns,” he told Times of Malta. Shocked by the impact, Di Dio said he could not identify the van but recalled opening his eyes to see the driver standing over him. According to Di Dio, the man looked South Asian and was wearing a blue shirt. He believes he was driving a delivery van but is unsure which company the van belonged to. “He came over, checked I was alive, told me nothing and rushed off,” he said. “I know if I saw him, I would recognise him.” Thankfully, other drivers stopped to help Di Dio. He was taken to Mater Dei Hospital, where he said he had to wait between six to seven hours before being seen. “That was horrible. I couldn’t take it anymore and began to scream out in pain, and only then did they see me,” he said. He was initially told he had minor injuries and was prescribed painkillers. But after several days, his wounds became increasingly painful and doctors at Saint James Hospital later confirmed they were infected. Alongside the physical injuries, Di Dio said his motorbike was damaged and he incurred around €4,000 in expenses for medical treatment, medications, transport and missed work. “I want a refund for the damages but the most important thing is I want to find out who hit me to avoid future accidents,” he said.  After being treated, Di Dio filed a police report. He hoped CCTV footage from the tunnel would help identify the van. But he said police informed him that the security cameras inside the Ta’ Giorni tunnels do not work. “It’s insane. The policeman told me that none of the cameras they have for the tunnels work,” he said. “I told them that it is impossible but they told me again that none of them work.” In 2020, the government launched a €10 million project to upgrade Malta’s major tunnels, including Ta’ Giorni, which included the installation of security cameras. When asked if the cameras were working on the day of the incident, the transport ministry said: “The Traffic Control Centre did not have CCTV coverage in the mentioned area on the 2nd of July 2025.” The ministry did not answer questions about whether the cameras are operational. Police confirmed that a report on the accident had been filed and investigations are ongoing. In 2022, a Transport Malta spokesperson told Times of Malta that tunnel cameras were linked to the authority’s traffic control centre, and used for both congestion monitoring and automatic incident detection.",12:30,20/07/2025,minor,pedestrian,PED,['22'],[],22,"Regional Road, Swieqi",Regional Road,Swieqi,6,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,4,1,Afternoon

10/10/2025,"The Mayor of Għajnsielem on Friday called on the authorities to install speed cameras and traffic calming measures along Triq l-Imġarr after a four-vehicle collision left two people in hospital. One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr.
